# Exercises for Introduction to Software Development

This repository contains programming exercises for course _Introduction to Software Development_. 

All the exercises include a template for the program to be developed. The template consists of three files, an HTML-file (`index.html`), a CSS-file (`styles.css`) and a JavaScript file (`script-js`). 

The templates may utilize programming concepts and tehcniques that are beyond the scope of the course to make the programs more interesting. However, one only needs to modify the JavaScript file to complete the assignments. All other files should be left as they are.

## Getting started

1. If you do not have `git` installed on your computer, [download and install it](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. Clone this repository to your work space using `git`: 

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/mruonavaara/isd-exercises
    ```

    The command creates a subfolder and brings a clone of the contents of this repository into it.

3. Pick an assignment, copy the template folder of the exercise to your workspace and start coding. 
 
Every assignment has a description that describes the task at hand and provides guidance on how to approach the solution. The template file may also include helpful comments.

There may be updates to this repository in future. To update the assignments give command `git pull`.
