# Exercises for Introduction to Software Development

This repository contains programming exercises for the course _Introduction to Software Development_.

Each exercise includes a template for the program to be developed. The template usually consists of three files: an HTML file (`index.html`), a CSS file (`styles.css`), and a JavaScript file (`script.js`).

There are two categories of exercises:

1. **Basic exercises** are designed to be completed as each topic is introduced. Their purpose is to help you progressively learn the topic.
2. **Applied exercises** are intended for later, allowing you to apply your programming skills to broader problems.

The templates, especially in the applied exercises, may use programming concepts and techniques that are beyond the current stage or even the scope of the course to make the programs more interesting. However, you only need to modify the JavaScript file to complete the assignments. All other files should be left unchanged.

## Getting started

1. If you do not have `git` installed on your computer, [download and install it](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. Clone this repository to your workspace using `git`:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/mruonavaara/isd-exercises
    ```

    This command creates a subfolder and copies the contents of this repository into it.

3. Pick an assignment, copy the template folder of the exercise to your workspace, and start coding.

Each assignment has a description that explains the task and provides guidance on how to approach the solution. The template files may also include helpful comments.

There may be updates to this repository in the future. To update the assignments, use the command `git pull`.
